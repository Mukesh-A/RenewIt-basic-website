        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          The Dell XPS 13 OLED is what happens when the best laptop meets the
          latest display technology. Combining the two creates something close
          to magic — an ultra-portable device capable of running most tasks
          while providing a cinema-like viewing experience. Everything we love
          about the other XPS configurations remains, including the fast
          performance, striking design and top-rate touchpad. The latest XPS 13
          model debuts a gorgeous OLED panel that provides rich picture quality
          for when you're streaming movies at home or editing videos for work.
          Is it worth the tradeoff to battery life? If you need a high-res
          display, then yes. The 3.5K OLED display outlasted the 4K IPS config
          in our battery test and is capable of producing a wider range of
          colors. Equipped with an Intel Core i7-1185G7 CPU with 16GB of RAM,
          the XPS 13 is small but mighty.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Welcome to the new era of Apple computing. Apple’s M1 custom SoC marks
          the first step in Apple’s conscious uncoupling from Intel. The
          ARM-based 5-nanometer chip has 16 billion transistors, which is the
          most the company has ever put into a chip. In addition to all those
          transistors, the SoC features an eight-core processor, integrated
          graphics, a unified memory architecture, Apple’s Neural Engine, an
          improved image signal processor and Apple’s Secure Enclave. The result
          is a faster, more powerful laptop that's a force to be reckoned
          with.The MacBook Pro 13-inch M1 delivers impressive performance and
          has the longest battery life we’ve ever seen on a Mac. If that’s not
          enough, paired with Big Sur, you get blistering webpage load times and
          a better webcam experience –– all thanks to Apple Silicon. In short,
          the new MacBook Pro is everything Apple said and more.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Acer Swift 3 (Late 2021)</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          The Acer Swift 3 is an ultra-thin, sleek, silver, peppy performer
          meant to help college-bound students transition to the next level of
          their education and make life much smoother. It has a nice design with
          some cool chrome accents that give a touch of flair. You get decent
          performance out of the 11th Gen Intel Core i7 CPU and solid rendering
          from the Intel Iris Xe GPU. The Swift 3 is a solid, budget-friendly
          ultra-thin laptop and travel partner that won’t slow you down. It's a
          tiny workhorse that performed well on a number of our benchmarks.
          Plus, it has staying power with over 10 hours of battery life. Plus,
          it's got premium good looks and a rather comfortable keyboard. The
          laptop does have one flaw however, its display which isn't as bright
          as we would like. But for the price, it's a minor quibble for a
          sub-$1,000 laptop.
